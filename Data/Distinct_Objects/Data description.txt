Data description of DistinctObjects:

Goal: count the number of objects (circles).

1, 2 or 3 circles are being randomly generated that have the same color but vary in size. On top of that some random noise is placed.

There are two dataset types: planned and actual. The shapes do not overlap, but might barely touch (so, planned and actual are almost identical).
