# LRP experiments with simple datasets

Python code that tests the LRP toolbox on some simple datasets.

## Getting Started

1. Set the paths and datanames in settings.py appropriate at your machine.
2. Train a neural network (nn) in train_nn.py.
3. Analyse the neural network using the LRP toolbox in main.py.

### Prerequisites

Tested with Python 2.7.
