Some random comments by Joost:
- It seems that the function numSubplots is missing. I downloaded it at: https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26310-numsubplots-neatly-arrange-subplots
- I was a bit confused about where to place the data from the Dropbox in the current repository. When binary = false, it couldn't find the data. I now placed the "gray" folder in \XAI\Data\TrianglesAndSquaresRotation.
- Where can I find information about how work with "modules" and setting up a neural network with LRP toolbox? The doc in Matlab does not contain a lot of information. Wait! It is contained in the manual! Hmm, modules.Convolution() is not explained there... Ah, see code for details: https://github.com/sebastian-lapuschkin/lrp_toolbox/blob/master/matlab/%2Bmodules/Convolution.m
- Documentation https://github.com/sebastian-lapuschkin/lrp_toolbox/blob/master/matlab/%2Bmodules/Flatten.m is confusing because it states that it is a rectification layer?
- Why do the rows in Pred = lenet.forward(test_images); do not add up to one (in test_lenet_tri_sq_rot.m)?
- '...\XAI\Data\TrianglesAndSquaresRotation\Gray\TrianglesAndSquares_images_train_50k.mat'. No such file or directory. Do I miss something?
- Where are the training and validate sets of grey variant? (asked question to Elena by mail). Elena added it to the shared Dropbox folder.
- It seems that "The sum of pred_classes and sum of relevance scores (after LRP)" are not equal to each other... It should be, right?
- For more details about how to setup a nn see: https://github.com/sebastian-lapuschkin/lrp_toolbox/blob/master/matlab/training_test.m
- Even the neural network 

net = modules.Sequential({
                            modules.Linear(32^2, 2),...
                            modules.SoftMax()
                            });

already seems to give roughly the same results. Is that logical? On the other hand

net = modules.Sequential({
                            modules.Linear(32^2, 2),...
                            });

does not and seems to be independent on the selected shape.
- Why does neural network

net = modules.Sequential({
                            modules.Linear(32^2, 2),...
                            modules.Linear(2, 2),...
                            });
							
give NaN numbers in the heatmap?
- Warning: if you have some commented lines in the Sequential constructor, it does not work when setting the neural network.
